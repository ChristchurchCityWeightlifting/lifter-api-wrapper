Lifter API Wrapper follows the [Conventional Commits Guidelines, please have a look](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

Additionally, it is recommended to use [`pre-commit` for local development](https://pre-commit.com/). This will ensure consistent code quality before each commit.

For testing, it will be a good idea to also clone the [Lifter API](https://github.com/WeightliftingNZ/lifter-api) as this is required to run tests.

## Styles

Docstrings are in [Google format](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

The function and variables names are to use snake case (e.g. `snake_case`).
